Color is one of the most important things in human’s life. It
defines the characteristics of an image. Unfortunately, not all
people can see the difference between these colors. The
purpose of this project is to develop an application that can
solve the color blindness problem, and make colour blinded
people can easily see the difference in the colors. The oxford
dictionary defined color as “The property possessed by an
object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result
of the way it reflects or emits light” [1]. A range of colors can
be created by the primary colors of pigment and these colors
then define a specific color space. Color space, also known as
the color model (or color system), is an abstract mathematical
model which simply describes the range of colors as tuples of
numbers, typically as 3 or 4 values or color components [2].
There are some color spaces, one of them that will be used in
this program is RGB (Red Green Blue). An RGB image is a
colorful image consisting of fixed values of color contents for
each pixel. These color contents have different values ranging
from 0 to 255 [3]. Colourblind, also known as color vision
deficiency is a decreased ability to see the differences of color.
Color blindness may make someone’s activity more difficult
because color blinded people more difficult to distinguish
certain colors such as blue and yellow or red and green [4].


—In this project, a trial is an attempt to make aid for color
blinded people so they can detect and classify colors. Color spaces
that will be used in this program is RGB (Red Green Blue). The image
processing technique is used for identifying the colors in an image.
